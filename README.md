# Pokedex

This is my final project for my Java II course. Decided to do something fun and
fulfill a childhood dream of having a Pokedex. Several liberties were taken to fulfill
the requirements for the project.

Project requirements from class:
-- at least one instantiable class with:
  - at least 3 fields (instance variables)
  - at least one constructor
  - Get / Set / Property methods for each instance variable
  - a toString method
  - an equals method
  - an extractor method
  - Javadoc comments at the top of the class and on each method

-- a GUI interface created with SceneBuilder. The GUI should have:
  - a ListView
  - a detail section that includes one Label and one TextField for each field.
  - 3 buttons that allow the user to Add, Update, and Delete items
  - 3 additional buttons that allow the user to load data from an API, save data to a file, and load data from a file

-- a Controller that:
  - populates the TextFields (or other controls) when an item is selected in the ListView
  - Provides code for all six buttons
  - binds the buttons so they are appropriately enabled / disabled

-- API functionality:
  - load data from an API. Choose an API we have not worked with in class

-- File functionality
  - Allow the user to save the data to a file (text or binary format).
  - You don't have to prompt the user for a file name.
  - Allow the user to load data from the file.
